# principal_harmonics
This is the supplimentary material to my Bachelor's thesis 'Learning Generative
models from Acoustic Sound Sources', supervised by Dr. Thomas Hermann.

* `principal_harmonics` contains the Python package with the actual software
* `notebooks` contains a set of Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the results in
  the report
* `static-notebooks` contains a pdf-baked version of the Jupyter notebooks
* similiarly, `static-wavs` contains a copy of the audio samples generated by
  the Jupyter notebooks.

## Installation
To install the software package, I recommend using conda:

```
conda create -n principal_harmonics python=3.9
conda activate principal_harmonics
git pull https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/lukas.middelberg/principal_harmonics.git
cd principal_harmonics
pip install .
```

Dependencies are listed in `setup.py`, but should be automatically installed
when using `pip install .`

To import the package, write
```
import principal_harmonics as ph
```
